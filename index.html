				<h3 class="homecolumns">Fee-only</h3>
					<p>Fee-only compensation means an advisor never accepts commissions or compensation related to the products he or she recommends,
					and does not accept or pay referral fees. A fee-only compensation structure enables us to offer completely objective advice without any 	conflict of interest. Fee-only firms are dramatically different from fee-based advisory services, where an advisor charges fees and accepts commissions.</p>
					<p>We offer clients an alternative to the commission or stockbroker world by delivering objective advice free of ulterior motives and conflicts of interest. We establish relationships with our clients through full disclosure and build lasting connections with education and communication. Our sole desire is to monitor, maintain and improve our clients’ financial health through sound investments and careful planning.</p>

					<h4>Our Code of Ethics</h4>
						<p>We recognize our fiduciary responsibility to clients and to the public, and we uphold the highest standards of care in the industry by espousing and practicing the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Objectivity</li>
								<li>Fairness and Suitability</li>
								<li>Full Disclosure</li>
								<li>Confidentiality</li>
								<li>Integrity and Honesty</li>
								<li>Professionalism and Competence</li>
								<li>Regulatory Compliance</li>
